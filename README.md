# chromalisp / XMLMML
MLL (Music Lisp Language) interpreter (MML spin-off). This repo is an attempt to mix MML with Lisp and XML, didn't go so well (Lisp makes parsers and syntax unbearable, XML takes too much space).

This project is discontinued. I'm going back to one of its ancesters, [bleeperpreter](https://github.com/p6nj/bleeperpreter).
